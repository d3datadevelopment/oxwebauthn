# DÂ³ WebAuthn / FIDO2 Login for OXID eShop

With this module, the login in the OXID shop can be carried out with a hardware token instead of a password. 

This secures the login in the frontend and (if allowed for the user) also in the backend.

Security keys are devices that contain cryptographic keys. These can be used for two-factor authentication. The security key must support the standard "[WebAuthn](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#webauthn-authenticator)".

The key management is done in the admin area and in the user's "My Account".

This package requires an Composer installed OXID eShop as defined in [composer.json](composer.json).

```bash
php composer require d3/oxwebauthn:^1.0
``` 

If a reference to an unsuitable package `symfony/process` is shown, this must be changed. To do this, please add the switch `-W` to the above command (`... require -W ...`).
