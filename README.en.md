# DÂ³ WebAuthn / FIDO2 Login for OXID eShop

With this module, the login in the OXID shop can be carried out with a hardware token instead of a password. 

This secures the login in the frontend and (if allowed for the user) also in the backend.

Security keys are devices that contain cryptographic keys. These can be used for two-factor authentication. The security key must support the standard "[WebAuthn](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#webauthn-authenticator)".

The key management is done in the admin area and in the user's "My Account".

## Installation

This package requires an Composer installed OXID eShop as defined in [composer.json](composer.json).

Open a command line interface and navigate to the shop root directory (parent of source and vendor). Execute the following command. Adapt the paths to your environment.

```bash
php composer require d3/oxwebauthn:^1.0
``` 

If a reference to an unsuitable package `symfony/process` is shown, this must be changed. To do this, please add the switch `-W` to the above command (`... require -W ...`).

Activate the module in the admin area of the shop in "Extensions -> Modules".

## Usage

The shop account is opened (as usual) with user name and password. Afterwards, [FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/) keys can be added as an additional authentication option. From this moment on, logging into the shop (frontend and backend) can be done either with FIDO2 or with password. Both work independently of each other.

Logging in with password does not differ from the shop standard and remains as a fallback option.

To use the registered FIDO2 keys, simply leave the password field blank when logging in. As soon as at least one character is entered in the password field, a login with password is assumed. If the password field is left blank, the system checks for the existence of a key registration and, if successful, requests the corresponding device. If there is no registration, a login with password is also assumed.

The keys can be easily managed in the My Account area of the frontend and also in the customer account in the backend. The administration includes the registration of new keys (multiple keys per account are possible and recommended). A free text name can be assigned to each key. Furthermore, all registered keys are displayed with their names. Registered keys can also be deleted there.

Any FIDO2-certified hardware can be used for registration. This can be USB tokens (e.g. Solokey or YubiKey), NFC or Bluetooth transmitters, smartphones (Android from version 7, iOS from version 14) or smartcards.

Since a password is no longer required with a FIDO2-based login, the password can also be more complex than passwords suitable for everyday use.
